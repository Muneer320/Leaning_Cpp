# Leaning_Cpp

Welcome to the **Leaning_Cpp** repository, a historic artifact from the time when I embarked on my C++ learning journey in December 2024. This repository documents the chaotic beauty of my experimentation and serves as a beacon of hope (or despair, depending on how you view it) for budding C++ learners.

## About This Repository

This repo contains my test files from my humble beginnings with C++. While I had a faint acquaintance with C++ before, I never officially tried to learn it (until now). Reading these files might give you whiplash as they oscillate between:

- **High-level sorcery** that makes you wonder if I’m secretly Linus Torvalds.
- **Kid-level chaos** that makes you question if I’ve ever seen a compiler before.

### Disclaimer:
I recommend not reading these files. I’m certainly not going to. But hey, if you’re feeling adventurous or just hate yourself, dive in! Just remember: the code is a reflection of a learning phase, not a polished product.

## Visionary Goals

By the time this repo enters the public domain (which is likely never), I hope to:

1. Master C++ in its entirety.
2. Create a groundbreaking search engine that overthrows Google (using C++ of course).
3. Convince you that if this hasn’t happened yet, you’re simply in the wrong timeline. Because, obviously, I can never be wrong.

## Acknowledgments

A heartfelt thanks to:
- Everyone with a red squiggly line under their name in MS Word. Your criticism fuels greatness.

## Final Note

This repo is a monument to my learning journey—a journey filled with bugs, breakthroughs, and enough `std::cout` statements to write a novel. If you find value here, great! If not, well, at least I warned you.

<sub>If you made it this far, congratulations on being bored enough to read a README for a project that's not even a project. Honestly, what’s wrong with you? This masterpiece was obviously crafted by GPT while I laughed at the irony of wasting both of our time. Go touch grass or something.</sub>
